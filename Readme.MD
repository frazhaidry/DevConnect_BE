# **Project Overview: Social Connection Platform**

This project is a minimalistic social connection platform designed to enable users to discover and build meaningful connections. The platform prioritizes:  
- User security  
- Clean interaction flows  
- Efficient management of connection requests  

Built with **Node.js**, **Express**, and **MongoDB**, it ensures secure and scalable backend operations.

# **Key Features**

### **1. Authentication**
- **User Sign-Up/Login**: Secure registration and login using email and password.  
- **Password Hashing**: User passwords are hashed using **bcrypt** for enhanced security.  
- **JWT Authentication**: JSON Web Tokens are used for session management and stored in cookies.  

---

### **2. Middleware for Security**
- **Route Protection**: Ensures only authenticated users can access protected routes.  
- **Request Validation**: Validates incoming data to ensure compliance with security and logical constraints.  

---

### **3. User Profile Management**
- **Profile Editing**: Users can update their personal information (e.g., name, bio, and profile picture).  
- **Password Updates**: Allows users to securely change their password, with hashing applied before saving.  

---

### **4. Connection System**
- **Send Connection Requests**: Users can send connection requests with defined statuses:  
  - `interested`  
  - `ignored`  
- **Request Review**: Recipients can accept or reject connection requests.  
- **Validation**: Prevents duplicate or self-directed requests.  

---

### **5. Feed**
- **Dynamic User Feed**: Displays profiles of users not connected to the current user, excluding:  
  - Users who have ignored or rejected requests  
  - Already connected users or those with pending requests  
- **Pagination**: Handles large datasets efficiently by paginating the feed.  

---

### **6. Database Design**
- **MongoDB**:  
  - User schema stores personal details and connection statuses.  
  - Connection request schema tracks:  
    - Sender (`fromUserId`)  
    - Recipient (`toUserId`)  
    - Statuses (e.g., pending, accepted).  
  - Logical constraints ensure no duplicate or self-referencing requests.
